# Your Flutter is Corrupted - Here's What to Do

## 🚨 The Problem
Your Flutter installation is corrupted (missing files). It needs to be reinstalled.

## ✅ Solution: Use Android Studio (EASIEST - RECOMMENDED)

**This is the fastest way to get your app running!**

Android Studio comes with Flutter support built-in and will handle everything for you.

### Steps:

1. **Download Android Studio** (if you don't have it):
   - Go to: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Click "Download Android Studio"
   - Install it (use default settings)
   - ⏱️ Takes 20-30 minutes first time

2. **Open Your Project**:
   - Open Android Studio
   - Click "File" → "Open"
   - Navigate to: `C:\Users\kturn\OneDrive\Documents\warm_light_calculator`
   - Click "OK"

3. **Wait for Setup** (first time only):
   - Android Studio will download Flutter automatically
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for it to set up
   - You'll see progress bars at the bottom

4. **Run Your App**:
   - Look for a green play button ▶️ at the top toolbar
   - Click it
   - Choose "Chrome" from the device list
   - Your calculator app opens in Chrome! 🎉

**That's it!** No command line needed, no fixing Flutter, just click buttons.

## 🔧 Alternative: Reinstall Flutter (If You Want Command Line)

If you prefer using command line instead:

1. **Delete the corrupted Flutter**:
   - Go to: `C:\Users\kturn\OneDrive\Develop\flutter_windows_3.35.4-stable`
   - Delete the entire folder (or just rename it)

2. **Download Fresh Flutter**:
   - Go to: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
   - Download Flutter SDK ZIP
   - Extract to: `C:\Users\kturn\OneDrive\Develop\flutter` (simpler path!)

3. **Add to PATH** (if needed):
   - Windows Key + R
   - Type: `sysdm.cpl` → Enter
   - "Advanced" tab → "Environment Variables"
   - Edit "Path" → Add: `C:\Users\kturn\OneDrive\Develop\flutter\bin`

4. **Test**:
   - Open NEW PowerShell
   - Type: `flutter doctor`
   - Should work now!
